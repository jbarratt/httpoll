# httpoll

It was a dark and stormy night. You were about to make some (totally safe!) change to some http-serving system. But you just wanted that extra safety blanket to make sure it wasn't all going to explode as you worked.

Enter httpoll.

You ran

    $ httpoll http://domain1.com/foo http://domain2.com https://domain3.com

and were able to work in peace, a beautiful realtime feed of poll times scrolling away in your terminal.
